React Fiber is an internal implementation of the React library's reconciliation algorithm. It was introduced to address performance bottlenecks in React's previous reconciliation approach, known as the "stack" or "stack reconciler." Fiber was first announced by the React team in 2016 and became the default reconciliation engine with React version 16.

Here's an in-depth overview of React Fiber:

1. Reconciliation:
Old Reconciliation (Stack Reconciler): React traditionally used a recursive algorithm for reconciliation, which could lead to performance issues, especially in large and complex component trees.
Fiber Reconciliation: Fiber introduces a more flexible and incremental reconciliation algorithm, allowing React to pause and resume the rendering process, prioritize updates, and schedule work more efficiently.
2. Incremental Rendering:
Old Approach: The stack reconciler would attempt to complete the entire reconciliation in a single pass, potentially causing UI freezes and performance issues.
Fiber Approach: Fiber divides the reconciliation work into smaller units called "fibers" and uses a cooperative scheduling approach. It can interrupt and resume work, making the rendering process more predictable and responsive.
3. Prioritization:
Fiber introduces a priority model: Different types of updates are assigned different priority levels (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous, idle).
React can now interrupt work: Lower-priority work can be paused and higher-priority work can be prioritized, providing a more dynamic and responsive user interface.
4. Error Boundaries:
Better support for error boundaries: Fiber enhances React's ability to gracefully handle errors during rendering. Error boundaries can now catch errors in component lifecycles.
5. Concurrency:
Concurrent mode: Fiber allows for features like "Concurrent Mode," which enables React to work on multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main thread. This is particularly beneficial for creating smooth user interfaces.
6. Rendering Phases:
Fiber introduces multiple rendering phases: These include the render phase, reconciliation phase, and commit phase. Each phase has specific responsibilities and contributes to the overall rendering process.
7. Render Priority:
Time slicing: Fiber allows React to break down large units of work into smaller chunks, making it possible to spread the rendering process across multiple frames and improve overall responsiveness.
8. API Changes:
Changes to lifecycle methods: Some lifecycle methods are now considered unsafe and have been replaced with safer alternatives. For example, componentWillMount and componentWillUpdate have been replaced with componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.
React Fiber significantly improves the efficiency and responsiveness of React applications, especially in scenarios where the previous stack reconciler might have struggled. The introduction of Fiber marked a major milestone in the evolution of React's architecture.

In React, the terms "reconciliation," "diffing," and "Fiber" are closely related and are core concepts behind React's virtual DOM and the efficient updating of the user interface.

1. Reconciliation:
Reconciliation is the process of updating the DOM to match the desired representation of the UI. When a React component's state or props change, React needs to determine what parts of the DOM need to be updated to reflect these changes. Reconciliation is the algorithmic process used to efficiently make these updates.

React performs reconciliation by comparing the new virtual DOM representation of the UI with the previous one, identifying the differences (diffing), and then applying the necessary updates to the actual DOM. This process is crucial for maintaining a responsive and performant user interface.

2. Diffing:
Diffing is the process of finding the minimum number of operations required to transform one tree into another. In the context of React, this involves comparing the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one and identifying the differences (or "diffs") between them. React aims to minimize the number of DOM manipulations needed to update the user interface.

React uses a heuristic algorithm to efficiently perform this diffing process. It identifies changes in the component tree and optimizes the update process by minimizing the number of operations required to reflect those changes in the actual DOM.

3. Fiber:
Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm for handling the component tree and reconciliation process. It is an internal implementation detail of React and was introduced to address performance issues, particularly related to the ability to pause, abort, or prioritize certain updates.

The key idea behind Fiber is to break the reconciliation process into smaller, incremental units of work called "fibers." This allows React to work on a task, pause if needed, and later resume or prioritize other tasks. The Fiber architecture enables React to be more responsive and better handle large and complex component trees without blocking the main thread for too long.

Fiber introduces a more flexible and efficient way to manage the update lifecycle, making it possible for React to perform tasks like asynchronous rendering, concurrent updates, and better support for real-time interactions.

In summary, reconciliation is the overarching process of updating the DOM based on changes in the virtual DOM, diffing is the specific task of identifying the differences between virtual DOM trees, and Fiber is React's internal architecture that enables a more flexible and efficient reconciliation process, especially in dealing with large and dynamic user interfaces.

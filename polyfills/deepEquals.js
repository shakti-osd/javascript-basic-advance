/* 
In a JavaScript interview, if you're asked about a deep equality comparison and to implement it, the interviewer is likely referring to a comparison that not only checks if two objects are equal but also compares their nested properties deeply. Here's an explanation and a basic implementation:

Deep Equality in JavaScript
Shallow Equality: Shallow equality (regular equality) checks whether two values are equal at the top level, but it doesn't check nested structures.

Deep Equality: Deep equality compares objects by recursively comparing the values of all nested properties, ensuring that every property at each level is equal.

Implementation of Deep Equality
Here's a simple implementation using a recursive approach:

*/

function deepEquals(obj1, obj2) {
    // Check if both objects are of the same type
    if (typeof obj1 !== 'object' || typeof obj2 !== 'object') {
        return obj1 === obj2;
    }

    // Check if both objects have the same set of keys
    const keys1 = Object.keys(obj1);
    const keys2 = Object.keys(obj2);

    if (keys1.length !== keys2.length || !keys1.every(key => keys2.includes(key))) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively compare nested properties
    for (const key of keys1) {
        if (!deepEquals(obj1[key], obj2[key])) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // If all checks pass, the objects are deeply equal
    return true;
}

// Example usage
const objA = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const objB = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const objC = { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } };

console.log(deepEquals(objA, objB)); // true
console.log(deepEquals(objA, objC)); // false

/* 
This deepEquals function compares objects deeply by recursively checking their properties. It handles nested objects and arrays as well. Note that this is a basic implementation, and depending on specific requirements, you might need to add more checks or handle special cases.

In an interview, you can discuss the time complexity of your implementation and mention that it's generally O(n), where n is the total number of properties in the objects being compared.
